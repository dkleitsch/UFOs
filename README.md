# UFOs
## Overview
Using JavaScript and HTML, a webpage was created to display a data table about UFO sightings that can be filtered using multiple search criteria.
## Results
### Before Filtering
This is what the data table looks like before entering any search criteria.

### The Filtering Process
#### Date
To begin the filtering process, choose one search criteria.  This example started with a date (1/1/2010).  After typing in the desired date, either press enter or click away from the input field.  Doing this will activate the code and complete the filtering.

#### Country
Continue the filtering process by choosing another search criteria, if further filtering is desired.  This example chose country (US).  Follow the steps as before to complete the filtering.

#### State
If desired, continue filtering by choosing another search criteria.  This example chose state (CA) as the next filter.  Follow the previous steps to complete the filtering.

#### City
Filter the search further by choosing another search criteria.  This example chose city (El Cajon).  Follow the previous steps to complete the filtering.

#### Shape
The results can be filtered one more time by choosing to enter a shape.  This example chose to finish with shape (light).  Follow the previous steps to finish the filtering process.

### Summary
One drawback of this new design is that the data set contains only two entries from outside of the US.  One recommendation would be to find a new data set that contains more information from other countries to get a broader picture of UFO sightings or just confine the data to the US.  Another recommendation for improvement would be to include a search button for the user to push once they are finished entering all their search criteria, rather than filtering one by one.
